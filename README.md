### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Hongrun(she/her/hers)!
I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Carnegie Mellon University.

My interest is in backend software engineering ðŸ’» -- including but not restricted to distributed systems, infrastructure, security and cloud, etc.
My favorite languages are C++, Go and Java â˜•

I also have a passion for music ðŸŽ¼ , and I sometimes work on music technology and physical computing projects outside of work/study.

Check out some of the fun stuff I've created during my time at CMU ðŸŒŸ
